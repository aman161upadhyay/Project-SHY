**S**elenium-**HY**drogen Bonds' Existential Crisis 

Our Thesis Hypothesis was "Existence of Selenium Hydrogen Bonds in Biomolecules". This isn't known to occur since the electronegativity of both Selenium and Hydrogen is same - 2.1. 
Processing PDB files for extraction of coordinates, B factors, geometric parameters, and other statistical results necessary for conducting Quantum Mechanical Computations to analyse bonding characteristics and to assess the presence of hydrogen bonds with Selenium as the main atom.

Results of the analysis are confidential/proprietary and not to be revealed until publication.
